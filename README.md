# Fetal Detection and Classification

This project uses a deep learning model to:
- Segment ultrasound images
- Calculate Head Circumference (HC) and Biparietal Diameter (BPD)
- Classify the fetus into "Normal," "Microcephaly," or "Macrocephaly"

## Instructions

1. Upload an ultrasound image in the app.
2. View the segmentation mask and calculated measurements (HC and BPD).
3. Enter the gestational age to classify the fetus.

## Setup
